**This is my project for the ML exam.**

**The Goal**: In this project, you will take the role of a data scientist in an insurance company. Your task is to build a machine learning model able to predict the severity of a crash, that is useful to embed into the pricing of an insurance policy.

***The Goal in a nutshell***: Binary Classification, 0 = Low Intensity Crash whereas 1 = High intensity Crash.

**In this code you'll find**:
1) **Exploratory Data Analysis**, also with Sweetviz and y-pandas profiling
2) **Data Cleaning and Feature engineering**
3) **Nested vs Stratified Cross Validation**
4) **GridSearch vs Optuna** for Hyperparameter tuning/optimization
5) **Models**
   - 5a) ***Lasso Logistic Regression***
   - 5b) ***Random Forest***
   - 5c) ***AdaBoost***
   - 5d) ***Gradient Boosting***
   - 5e) ***XGBOOST***
   - 5f) ***CATBOOST***
6) **Shap vs Lime**
7) **Writing efficient code: Pipeline**
